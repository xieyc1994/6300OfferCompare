**Author**: Team 35

## 1 Introduction

The JobCompare app will allow the user to compare two different jobs to one another.
It will allow the user to enter the details of the jobs as well as set the weights of their relative importance, and then present to the user a ranked list of their options.

## 2 Process Description

### Conduct Preliminary Work

- In this step, the team conducts the preliminary work required for the project. 
This includes activities such as gathering and understanding the requirements as well as planning for the rest of the project.
- Entrance criteria: Project requirements.
- Exit criteria: Team understanding of project requirements and goals. Team's roles are assigned.

### Create High Level Design

- The design phase of the project is conducted. The team prepares use cases to understand the end user's goals. 
The high level architecture is agreed upon and design documents are prepared. Additional design such as UI is drafted.
- Entrance Criteria: Project goals and requirements.
- Exit Criteria: Design documents necessary for implementation.

### Implemente Application

- The team works to create the application based on the design. The design is adjusted as needed as the team encounters implementation challenges.
Each team member will work on one aspect of the final application, but will help each other out as needed.
This is conducted in parallel to the test development to make sure the requirements are being met.
- Entrance Criteria: Requirements. Design documents.
- Exit Criteria: Working application.

### Create and Execute Tests

- The team creates test cases to ensure that the application is working as intended. 
Part of this involves verifying that the requirements are being met and the other part involves verifying that the implementation is free of bugs.
If the tests are failing, then work with implementors to fix the application (or fix the test, as the case may be).
Conducted in parallel with implementation.
- Entrance Criteria: Requirements. Design documents. Alpha version of the application.
- Exit Criteria: Test cases are implemented. Test cases are passing

### Perform Final Acceptance

- Team checks that the final application is ready for release. Team checks that all of the requirements are covered and that the test cases cover as much of the application as possible and that the application is free from bugs.
If everything is good to go, then the application can be released.
- Entrance Criteria: Release candidate version of the application. Requirements. Test cases.
- Exit Criteria: Final release of the application.
