**Design Discussion**

In order to document this part of the process, you must create a “design discussion” document with one section per team member. In their respective section, each team member will provide a concise description of their perceived pros and cons of the team design, possibly mentioning decisions on which they do not fully agree. The document should also contain a final section, called “Summary”, that concisely summarizes the lessons learned in the process of discussing the design, in terms of design elements, process, teamwork, or any other aspect that the team members consider relevant. Important: We will not use your discussion to evaluate and grade your design, and we do not expect that the whole team will see the design in exactly the same way. In other words, the team members should feel free to be candid in presenting their opinions (during the actual discussion and in the document). Keep in mind that design is always about trade-offs, and typically there is not a single “right” solution but rather multiple good ones.

_Compared to my original design, the team's design has added a ComparisonSettings class to store the weights, which I put in ComparisonManager originally. It is good as the modules are more clear. We also leave a User class there, which is not necessary at this moment, but might be useful for some improvements in the future._ 

**Shanshan Zhao, szhao319**

_Compared to my original design, I think the team's final design is more complete (i.e., has a Comparison Manager as a main 'entry' point) while more concise (i.e., does not have redundant 'derived' attributes such as the adjusted yearly salary). We also added necessary operations to the class diagram which I originally missed in my design. I do not see obvious defects in the team's final design at this moment._

**Dan Yu, dyu76**

_There were a lot of improvements to the details of my original draft in the final design. It was good combining all of our ideas into one. Some parts of it weren't explicitly asked for in the requirements document, but they're things that a user would reasonably want. If it turns out it's unnecessary, we can always remove it._ 

**Hemant Kurmi, hkurmi3**

_When we reviewed all the designs as a team, we found that each of us have something unique in th UML diagram. Like i was confused about the user class, the system was to compare the single user offers so we cant compare the offer of one user to other but still as per me there can be more then two users and both will have there on system to compare the offer. So there exist a User class with list of all users and current job details._

**Summary**

_Through the teamwork, our team was able to come up with a final design that merges individual's designs. The lessons we learned include_
    
_1. It is necessary to have a main entry point for this design._

_2. Derived attributes are not necessary to include in the design if they are easy to derive._
    
_3. Operations should be part of the designed classes and should contain any of the operations mentioned in the functional requirements._
